THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE

Once upon a time, a speedy hare boasted about how fast he could run. Tired of hearing his bragging, Slow and Steady, the tortoise, challenged him to a race. All the animals in the forest gathered to watch.

The hare sprinted down the road, leaving the tortoise behind. Confident of victory, he paused to rest. Meanwhile, the tortoise plodded on steadily. When the hare woke up from his nap, he was surprised to find the tortoise near the finish line. Despite the hare’s swift sprint, he couldn’t catch up in time. The moral of the story? Slow and steady wins the race!
